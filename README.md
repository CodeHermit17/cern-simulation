# ðŸ§ª CERN Simulation Project

A simulation and analysis project using **ROOT toolkit** and **C++** to mimic particle interactions and experiment-style data analysis, inspired by CERNâ€™s open data projects.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Learn ROOT toolkit for particle physics data analysis
- Simulate and visualize basic particle collisions/events
- Build strong project foundation for **CERN internship applications**

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Languages
- C++
- ROOT framework (by CERN)
- matplotlib-cpp (optional for visualization)

---

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

-cern-simulation/

- src/ # All .cpp source files
- data/ # Input/output simulation data
- plots/ # Graphs and visualizations
- README.md # Project overview

---

## ðŸ§ª Planned Features
- [ ] Simple event generation (electron-proton, etc.)
- [ ] Kinematics & invariant mass plots
- [ ] Histogramming and ROOT plotting
- [ ] Real data comparison (from CERN open data)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Note
This is a **work in progress** as part of my CERN internship preparation track (2025).
